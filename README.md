# ContentFul_DE_TEST

1). Config.yml file contains all the Token/Keys/Parameters that needs to be controlled overtime and can be changed later on. 
So for the sake of accessibility and security such parameters are stored in Config file, these are later on used in the code whereever is 
required.

2). Twitter_Influence_Extract.py contains all the functions for extracting, cleansing,persisting and accessing the twitter data. 
Sample calls are made in the Main function of the code to give an idea about the functionality of the code.

3). Comments are properly given whereever seem necessary

4). Data Model and Document containing the MVP of the product is sent through the email containing the link of GitHub repository.
Please go through that as well to get the better understanding of thinking methodology behind this code and design
